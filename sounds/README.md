# Sound Files for WhispNote

This directory contains the sound effects used in the WhispNote application:

- `start.mp3`: Played when recording starts
- `stop.mp3`: Played when recording stops
- `save.mp3`: Played when a note is successfully saved

Note: You'll need to add your own sound files here. You can find free sound effects at:
- [Freesound](https://freesound.org/)
- [Mixkit](https://mixkit.co/free-sound-effects/)
- [Zapsplat](https://www.zapsplat.com/)

The sound files should be short (less than 1 second) and in MP3 format for the best compatibility.
